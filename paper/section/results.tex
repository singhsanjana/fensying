Through experiments, it was observed that the two most expensive operations
in the entire process are - computing transitive relations for \setHB's and
computing all possible cycles in the graph of \setTO relations. The algorithm 
to compute all elementary cycles in the directed graph implements
Johnson's algorithm \ref{networkx-cycles}.

Table \ref{fig:tabl1} contains a few of the benchmarks used to test this tool.
These benchmarks have been taken from different model checking tools and amended
according to our specifications. At a first glance, it can be noted that
the major factors directly affecting the tool time are- the number of buggy executions
and the number of instructions in each execution.

Firstly, the number of buggy executions affects the tool time since each execution
is being computed and being sent through a series of steps. Hence, more executions means more
computation time. On the other hand, the number of instructions in each trace 
determines the number of relations being formed. A greater number of instructions
results in more \setHB relations. The number of fences to be put between each instruction also
increases and hence, the number of TO relations increases, since all fences are of the
\mosc memory order. Finally, a sizeable graph with many TO relations
results in an exponential number of cycles.

To combat this problem of number of cycles or number of buggy executions going out of bounds,
an optimization had been introduced and discussed in \ref{sec:optis}. Table \ref{fig:tabl2}
has results of some of the biggest programs in our set with the flag \texttt{-t 1},
which means it looks at only the first trace at a time. Results state that
in most cases, the number of fences remains the same as they were with the 
full optimization. In some of the examples, however, an additional fence or two
is added. The tool time is always considerably lesser when compared with
the original optimization.
