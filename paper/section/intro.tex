% ------------ INTRO PARAS ------------------
\par
A programmer working with relaxed memory constraints would want all the advantages of the relaxed model - such as speed and concurrency. However, using relaxed memory constraints comes with its own issues. In relaxed memory models, memory operations such as \textit{reads} and \textit{writes} can be reordered in order to achieve these properties. These instruction reorderings can cause certain variables to have different values in different execution runs of the same program, hence resulting in behaviour which is unexpected or surprising. These include not behaving according to sequentially consistent standards, or outputting unexpected values of variables.

\par
In this project, we suggest an approach to prevent certain unexpected behaviour, such as unexpected outputs due to concurrent instruction re-orderings in the C11 relaxed model.

\par
To tackle this, the programmer may add \textit{"assert"} statements in the source code, which will check that certain properties remain unchanged in each run of the program, such as the value of a variable in a certain thread. Each program will have several possibilities of runs where instructions will be executed in different orders. In some of these runs, there might be cases where the assertion does not hold and it gets violated. In the case that the \textit{assert} statement gets violated, the program execution will stop. The object of this project is to insert a minimum number of \textbf{C11 fences} in the source code of the program at the right places so that these assertions are satisfied and do not get violated.

% -------------------- MOTIVATION E.G. ------------------------
\subsection{Motivation Example}

\par
In a sequentially consistent model, the multi-threaded program in Fig \ref{fig:dekker1} would execute the instructions in a sequentially consistent order. The final values read by variable \textit{t} would be 1 and 0 for each thread respectively. Therefore it can be said that the ``output'' would always be ``10''. However, in the case of a relaxed model, such as in a C11/C++11 program when all the instructions are relaxed, reading outputs of ``00'', ``01'', ``11'' may even be possible, thereby violating the rules of sequential consistency. Such an output may or may not be unexpected for the programmer, depending upon their requirements.

\par
For this reason, the programmer needs to provide their requirements about what values are expected at which locations by specifying a local safety property.

\end{figure}

\par
Such a specification may be made in the form of assertions. In Fig \ref{fig:dekker2} the memory orders of all the instructions would be \morlx in the C11 memory model. Now in order to preserve the final output values, the read statements at the end of the threads can be converted into \texttt{assert(R$\mathtt{_{rlx}}$c == 1)} and \texttt{assert(R$\mathtt{_{rlx}}$c == 0)} in each thread respectively. At the end of the threads, this safety property might not be satisfied. In this case, the program stops or exits, giving an error output. The objective of the tool to be created is to prevent the program from exhibiting behaviour which is unexpected for the programmer, hence preventing the error output as well as ensuring the provided specifications. For the purposes of this paper, we require the safety property to be specified as assertions in the program.
