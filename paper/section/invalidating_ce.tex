As discussed in Section~\ref{sec:c11}, in a valid trace of the
input program $P$ (including a buggy trace), 
the program events must satisfy the \hlref{coherence conditions}.
%
Contrarily, if we synthesize \cc fences in the input program 
such that the irreflexivity of any of the coherence conditions 
or the total order on \sc events in the buggy trace gets violated 
then we can invalidate the trace and stop the program behavior.

Assume a set of synthesized \cc fences $\overline{\fences_{\tau'}}$
in a transformation $\tau'$ of a buggy trace $\tau$. 
%
The synthesized fences inflate the 
$\setSB$, $\setSW$ and $\setDOB$ relation sets by adding 
relations between program events ($\events_\tau$) and newly 
added fences ($\sfences_{\tau'}$) to form corresponding 
$\seqb{\tau'}{}{}$, $\sw{\tau'}{}{}$ and $\dob{\tau'}{}{}$ 
relations (as explained in Section~\ref{sec:c11}). 
%
Further, the $\ithb{\tau'}{}{}$ relation contains  
program event pairs as a consequence of the freshly formed 
$\sw{\tau'}{}{}$ and $\dob{\tau'}{}{}$ relations in addition
to the event pairs in $\setITHB$.
%
The $\mo{\tau'}{}{}$, $\rf{\tau'}{}{}$ and $\fr{\tau'}{}{}$ 
relations remain the same as the corresponding relations of 
$\tau$, as fences do not contribute to these relations.

We propose two strategies, namely \stfence and \wkfence, to 
detect invalidation of the program trace $\tau$. 
%
The \wkfence strategy detects violation of a coherence condition.
If such a case exists then we can stop the behavior by
synthesizing weaker fences (memory orders \rel, \acq, \acqrel). 
%
However, if a coherence condition is not violated then we move
to \stfence strategy to break the total order requirement on
\sc ordered events and stop the behavior by synthesizing 
strong (\sc ordered) fences.
%
The strategies are discussed below.\newline

{\bf Invalidate by violating coherence condition (\wkfence)}\newline
The \wkfence strategy simply attempts to detect a cycle in 
one of the \hlref{coherence conditions} listed in 
Section~\ref{sec:c11}.
%
Consider the example \hlref{WRIR}. Since, the trace does not 
violate any coherence condition it is a valid trace under \cc. 
Assume that the trace shown in the figure is a counter example.
%
Synthesizing release fence $\mathbb{F^\rel}$ and acquire fence 
$\mathbb{F^\acq}$ as shown in \hlref{WRIR-invalidated} forms
a cycle in $\setMO;\setRF;\setHB;\setRF^{-1}$ thus violating the
coherence of the trace.

However, inserting fences in a buggy trace may not be sufficient for 
violating a coherence condition. Consider example \hlref{mutex} and
its transformation \hlref{mutex-fences} with synthesized fences. 
%
As can be seen from \hlref{mutex-fences}, even after inserting fences 
at every location in the buggy trace, the trace still satisfies all 
coherence conditions and is thus valid.
\newline

\noindent
{\bf Invalidating by violating \sc total-order (\stfence)}\newline
If the \wkfence strategy fails to invalidate the buggy trace then
we attempt to violate the total-order on \sc events.
%
Since the coherence condition did on violate on the events of $\tau'$ 
it implies that conditions do not violate on the \sc ordered events
of $\tau'$ either. 
%
As a result in the \stfence strategy we attempt to violate the 
irreflexivity condition on 
$(\onsc{\hb{\tau'}{}{}}$ $\union$ $\onsc{\mo{\tau'}{}{}}$ $\union$ 
$\onsc{\rf{\tau'}{}{}}$ $\union$ $\onsc{\fr{\tau'}{}{}})^+$. 

We introduce a possibly reflexive relation on \sc-ordered
events of $\tau'$, called {\em \sc-order} $(\so{\tau'}{}{})$ to 
capture the ordering between the \sc events. 
%
\begin{definition}{\bf \sc-order ($\so{\tau'}{}{}$)}\newline
	$\forall e_1, e_2 \in \events_\tau$ \st 
	$(e_1,e_2) \in$ $\setHB$ $\union$ $\setMO$ $\union$ $\setRF$ 
	$\union$ $\setFR$
	
	if
	$e_1, e_2 \in \ordevents{\sc}_\tau$ then 
	$\so{\tau'}{e_1}{e_2}$;
	
	if
	$e_1 \in \ordevents{\sc}_\tau$, 
	$\exists \mathbb{F}^\sc \in \ordsfences{\sc}_{\tau'}$ where
	$\seqb{\tau'}{e_2}{\mathbb{F}^\sc}$ then
	$\so{\tau'}{e_1}{\mathbb{F}^\sc}$;
	
	if
	$e_2 \in \ordevents{\sc}_\tau$, 
	$\exists \mathbb{F}^\sc \in \ordsfences{\sc}_{\tau'}$ where
	$\seqb{\tau'}{\mathbb{F}^\sc}{e_1}$ then
	$\so{\tau'}{\mathbb{F}^\sc}{e_2}$;
	
	if
	$\exists \mathbb{F}^\sc_1$, $\mathbb{F}^\sc_2$ 
	$\in \ordsfences{\sc}_{\tau'}$ where
	$\seqb{\tau'}{\mathbb{F}^\sc_1}{e_1}$ and 
	$\seqb{\tau'}{e_2}{\mathbb{F}^\sc_2}$ then
	$\so{\tau'}{\mathbb{F}^\sc_1}{\mathbb{F}^\sc_1}$.
\end{definition}
%
Note that, $\setSO \subseteq \setTO$ for any trace $\tau$. It
does not contain pairs of \sc events that do not have a definite
order. 
%
Consider the example \hlref{WRWR}, $\to{}{W^\sc(x,1)}{W^\sc(y,1)}$
and $\to{}{W^\sc(y,1)}{W^\sc(x,1)}$ are both valid total-orders
on the \sc events of the trace.
%
The set $\setSO$ does not contain either of the two cases and 
would be empty for this example.
%
Such a candidate pair of events cannot contribute to the 
reflexivity of $\setSO$ and can be safely ignored for the
purpose of this work.

Consider again the example \hlref{mutex} without synthesized fences.
Upon synthesizing \sc fences $\mathbb{F}^\sc_1$ and 
$\mathbb{F}^\sc_2$ as shown in \hlref{mutex-invalidated} the
transformed trace forms the following $\so{}{}{}$ relations:

$\seqb{}{W^\sc(Flag_1,1)}{\mathbb{F}^\sc_1}$ $\implies$ $\so{}{W^\sc(Flag_1,1)}{\mathbb{F}^\sc_1}$

$\seqb{}{W^\sc(Flag_2,1)}{\mathbb{F}^\sc_2}$ $\implies$ $\so{}{W^\sc(Flag_2,1)}{\mathbb{F}^\sc_2}$

$\fr{}{R^\rlx(Flag_1,0)}{W^\sc(Flag_1,1)}$ $\implies$ $\so{}{\mathbb{F}^\sc_2}{W^\sc(Flag_1,1)}$

$\fr{}{R^\rlx(Flag_2,0)}{W^\sc(Flag_2,1)}$ $\implies$ $\so{}{\mathbb{F}^\sc_1}{W^\sc(Flag_2,1)}$

thus violating the total-order requirement on \sc events and
invalidating the trace with strong fences.
