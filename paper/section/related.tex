The literature in the  fence synthesis is dominated by 
techniques targeting the x86-TSO and sparc PSO memory models
such as \cite{abdulla2012counter,alglave2010fences,alglave2014don,linden2011verification,abdulla2012automatic,abdulla2015best,bender2015declarative} 
for x86-TSO,
\cite{abdulla2015precise,linden2013verification} 
for sparc PSO and \cite{liu2012dynamic,meshman2014synthesis,abdulla2013memorax,joshi2015property,kuperstein2012automatic}
for both TSO and PSO.
%
The technique \cite{bender2015declarative} additionally
provides fence synthesis for ARMv7 memory model and 
\cite{kuperstein2012automatic} additionally provides
fence synthesis for RMO memory model.
%
Apart from the techniques for TSO and PSO, a few 
fence synthesis techniques have been proposed for Power
memory model 
\cite{alglave2010fences,abdulla2015precise,fang2003automatic}, 
where \cite{fang2003automatic} also 
provides support for IA-32 memory model.

Some of the earlier works in the area 
\cite{alglave2010fences,abdulla2015precise,fang2003automatic} 
perform fence synthesis to reduce weak memory behaviors of an 
input program to those permitted under Sequential Consistency (SC)
or its variant \cite{abdulla2015best}.
