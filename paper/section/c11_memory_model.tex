The \cc memory model forms an irreflexive and acyclic relation over the events of 
an execution sequence $\tau$ called the {\em happens-before} relation 
($\setHB \subseteq \events_\tau {\times} \events_\tau$);
such that, the execution sequence is {\em coherent} (or valid) under \cc if 
the $\setHB$ relation does not violate any {\em coherence rule} of \cc.
%
The events of a sequence $\tau$ are related by the $\setHB$ as follows;
\begin{itemize}
	\item {\em Intra-thread-hb}: Events of a thread are related by a {\em sequenced-before}
	($\setSB$) relation in the order of occurrence in the thread;
	
	\item {\em Inter-thread-synchronization}: A $\moge$ \acq read event ($ra$) of a thread 
	$t_i$ when reads from a $\moge$ \rel write event $wr$ of another thread $t_j$ they form a
	relation {\em synchronizes-with} ($\setSW$) between them as $\sw{\tau}{wr}{ra}$.
	%
	Further, a $\moge$ \acq read event ($ra$) of a thread $t_i$ when reads from a write 
	event ($w$) in the {\em Release sequence} \cite{C11} of a $\moge$ \rel write event ($wr$) of 
	another thread $t_j$ then $wr$ and $ra$ form a relation {\em dependency-ordered-before}
	($\setDOB$) between them as $\dob{\tau}{wr}{ra}$;
	%
	(where, a release sequence headed by a $\moge$ \rel write event $wr$ is the maximal 
	contiguous sequence, of an execution sequence $\tau$, that starts with $wr$ and continues 
	over write events from the same thread and rmw events or $\moge$ \rel write events from
	other threads.)
	
	\item {\em Inter-thread-hb}: Events from different threads that are related by the 
	transitive closure of ($\setSB$ $\union$ $\setSW$ $\union$ $\setDOB$) are related by 
	the {\em inter-thread-hb} relation ($\setITHB$). 
\end{itemize}

Accordingly, two events $e_1,e_2$ in an execution sequence $\tau$ are happens-before 
related \ie
$\hb{\tau}{e_1}{e_2}$ if $\seqb{\tau}{e_1}{e_2}$ or $\ithb{\tau}{e_1}{e_2}$.
%
Additionally, in a sequence $\tau$, all write events of an object $x$ are related by a 
total order called {\em modification-order} ($\setMO$).
%
The $\setMO$ order is constructed in compliance to a set of coherence
\lmo-rules defined by \cc based on $\setHB$. 
%
We have listed the $\setMO$ coherence rules in Figure~\ref{fig:mo-to rules} and 
described them below.

\begin{itemize}
	\item \hlref{moWW}: $\setHB$-ordered writes are ordered by $\setMO$;
	\item \hlref{moRR}: $\setHB$ between reads forms $\setMO$ between their source
						writes (if they are different events);
	\item \hlref{moRW}: $\setHB$ order from a read to a write forms $\setMO$ between the
						source of the read and the hb-after write;
	\item \hlref{moWR}: $\setHB$ order from a write to a read forms $\setMO$ between
						the write and the source of the read (if the two are
						different events).
\end{itemize}

A valid \cc execution must have a total order on all events with memory
order \sc coherent \wrt $\setHB$ and $\setMO$, called \sc{\em -total-order} 
($\setTO$).
%
The \lto rules, derived from the $\setHB$ and \lmo-rules are formally presented in 
Figure~\ref{fig:mo-to rules} and discussed below.

\begin{itemize}
	\item \hlref{tohb}, \hlref{toWW},\hlref{toWR}: events ordered by $\setHB$, $\setMO$
						and $\setRF$ respectively are also ordered by $\setTO$;
	\item \hlref{toRW}: if the source write of a \sc read is $\setMO$(and $\setTO$)-ordered 
						before an \sc write then the read is also $\setTO$-ordered
						before that write;
	\item \hlref{toFW}{}
	\item \href{toFFrf}{}
