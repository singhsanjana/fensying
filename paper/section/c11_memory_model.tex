As discussed in Section~\ref{sec:preliminaries},
the \cc memory model defines a program trace by forming a set
of relations on the program events that follow \cc {\em coherence
rules}. 
%
\cc maintains {\em release sequences} in a trace that assist in
forming the event relations. A release sequence is the longest 
contiguous sequence of write (or rmw) events on an object $o$,
headed by a \rel or stricter write (or rmw) event, called a
{\em release head}. 
%
The sequence includes all events modification-ordered after the
release head and is broken by a weak write event from another thread.

The \cc memory model introduces an irreflexive and acyclic relation 
over the events of a trace $\tau$ called the {\em happens-before} 
relation ($\setHB$),
 \st $\setHB \subseteq \events_\tau {\times} \events_\tau$.
%
The happens-before relation is constructed by taking a union
of {\em sequenced-before} ($\setSB$) and {\em inter-thread-hb}
($\setITHB$). The components of happens-before are discussed
below.

\noindent
{\bf Sequenced-before($\setSB$)}: Events of a thread $P_i$  are 
	related by the {\em sequenced-before} relation ($\setSB$) in 
	their order of occurrence in $P_i$.
	
\noindent
{\bf Synchronizes-with($\setSW$)}: When a strict write $e_w$ 
	(memory order \rel or stricter) and a strict read $e_r$ 
	(memory order \acq or stricter) from different threads are 
	related as $\rf{\tau}{e_w}{e_r}$, they are also 
	related by the synchronizes-with as
	$\sw{\tau}{e_w}{e_r}$.

\noindent
{\bf Dependency-ordered-before($\setDOB$)}: When a strict read 
	$e_r$ (memory order \acq or stricter) is related to a write
	$e_w$ as $\rf{\tau}{e_w}{e_r}$ where $e_w$ belongs to the
	release sequence of a strict write $e_w'$ (memory order \rel 
	or stricter), $e_w'$ and $e_r$ are also related by the
	dependency-ordered-before \ie $\dob{\tau}{e_w'}{e_r}$.
	
\noindent
{\bf Inter-thread-hb($\setITHB$)}: The $\setSW$ and $\setDOB$
	relations form an inter-thread-hb between their corresponding 
	threads \ie $\sw{\tau}{e_w}{e_r}$ or $\dob{\tau}{e_w}{e_r}$
	$\implies$ $\ithb{\tau}{e_w}{e_r}$. Further
	all events $e,e'$ \st $\seqb{\tau}{e}{e_w}$ and 
	$\seqb{\tau}{e_r}{e'}$ are also related as $\ithb{\tau}{e}{e'}$.

Thus, two events $e_1,e_2$ in a trace $\tau$ are happens-before 
related \ie
$\hb{\tau}{e_1}{e_2}$ if $\seqb{\tau}{e_1}{e_2}$ $\v$ 
$\ithb{\tau}{e_1}{e_2}$.
%
As discussed previously, in a trace $\tau$, all write events of 
an object $o$ are related by a total order called 
{\em modification-order} ($\setMO$).
%
The $\setMO$ order is constructed in compliance with $\setHB$ and 
$\setRF$ such that $\setMO$, $\setRF$ and $\setHB$ must not 
disagree.
%
To meet the requirement \cc introduces a set of
coherence rules listed below \cite{LahavVafeiadis-PLDI17}.
A valid \cc trace must satisfy the conjunction
of the coherence rules.
%
\newline $\setHB$ is irreflexive
\newline $\setRF;\setHB$ is irreflexive
\newline $\setMO;\setRF;\setHB$ is irreflexive
\newline $\setMO;\setHB$ is irreflexive
\newline $\setMO;\setHB;\setRF^{-1}$ is irreflexive
\newline $\setMO;\setRF;\setHB;\setRF^{-1}$ is irreflexive

Finally, all \sc ordered events in a trace $\tau$ must be related
by a total order ($\setTO$) that concurs with the coherence rules.
%
We introduce an irreflexive relation called {\em from-reads} $\setFR$ 
that relates read events with write events ordered after it.
%
The relation from-reads is typically used for stricter memory models 
that relate all events of a trace by a total order,
such as sequentially-consistent memory model or TSO memory model.
\cc model constitutes a similar requirement on the \sc ordered
events of a trace and we use $\setFR$ it to define the $\setTO$
relation.
%
\begin{definition}[{\em from-reads} $\setFR$]
	$\setFR$ = $\setRF^{-1}$;$\setMO$
\end{definition}
%
Thus, the $\setTO$ must be constructed such that,

if 
$\to{\tau}{e^\sc_1}{e^\sc_2}$ then 
$\nhb{\tau}{e^\sc_2}{e^\sc_1}$ $\^$
$\nmo{\tau}{e^\sc_2}{e^\sc_1}$ $\^$
$\nrf{\tau}{e^\sc_2}{e^\sc_1}$ $\^$
$\nfr{\tau}{e^\sc_2}{e^\sc_1}$.

\noindent
In our technique we attempt to break the irreflexivity of either
a coherence rules or $\setTO$ by strategically placing \cc fences in 
the input program, as discussed in Section~\ref{sec:so theory}.

\noindent
{\bf Brief introduction to \cc fences}: 
\cc fences provide additional reordering restrictions on program 
events. Note that \cc fences are not memory barriers and do not
provide support for flushing local write values to shared memory.
%
A fence can be associated with memory orders $\rel$, $\acq$, 
$\acqrel$ and $\sc$
providing varying degrees of reordering restrictions.
%
Similar to program events, $\setSW$ and $\setDOB$ relations can also 
be formed between \cc fences and program events
\cite{batty2011mathematizing}\cite{C11} where an appropriately
placed fence assists a relaxed event in forming the necessary 
synchronization, as shown in the figure below.

\noindent
Formally, $\setSW$ relation is formed using fences as,

$\forall e_1, e_2 \in \events_\tau$ \st $\rf{\tau}{e_1}{e_2}$

if
$e_1 \in \ordwrites{\moge\rel}_\tau$, 
$\exists \mathbb{F}^\acq \in \ordfences{\moge\acq}_{\tau}$ where
$\seqb{\tau}{e_2}{\mathbb{F}^\acq}$ then
$\sw{\tau}{e_1}{\mathbb{F}^\acq}$;

if
$e_2 \in \ordreads{\moge\acq}_\tau$, 
$\exists \mathbb{F}^\rel \in \ordfences{\moge\rel}_{\tau}$ where
$\seqb{\tau}{\mathbb{F}^\rel}{e_1}$ then
$\sw{\tau}{\mathbb{F}^\rel}{e_2}$;

if
$\exists \mathbb{F}^\rel \in \ordfences{\moge\rel}_{\tau}$,
$\mathbb{F}^\acq \in \ordfences{\moge\acq}_{\tau}$ where
$\seqb{\tau}{\mathbb{F}^\rel}{e_1}$,
$\seqb{\tau}{e_2}{\mathbb{F}^\acq}$ 

then
$\sw{\tau}{\mathbb{F}^\rel}{\mathbb{F}^\acq}$.

\noindent
Similarly, $\setDOB$ relation is formed using fences as,

$\forall e_1, e_2 \in \events_\tau$, 
$e_1' \in \ordwrites{\moge\rel}_\tau$ \st $\rf{\tau}{e_1}{e_2}$
and $e_1 \in$ {\em release-sequence}($e_1'$)

if $\exists \mathbb{F}^\acq \in \ordfences{\moge\acq}_{\tau}$ 
where $\seqb{\tau}{e_2}{\mathbb{F}^\acq}$ then
$\dob{\tau}{e_1'}{\mathbb{F}^\acq}$.

\noindent
Further, as is the case with program events,
if $\sw{\tau}{e_1}{e_2}$ or $\dob{\tau}{e_1}{e_2}$ then
events $e_1',e_2'$ \st $\seqb{\tau}{e_1'}{e_1}$ and 
$\seqb{\tau}{e_2}{e_2'}$ are related as $\ithb{\tau}{e}{e'}$.
