Introduction:
	- exiting text
	- Motivation example
	- We require the safety property to be specified as assertion in program
	
Background/Preliminaries:
	The C11 Model: rlx < acq, rel < acq_rel < seq_cst
	Basic relations
	Notation: list all the notations used 

Proposed Solution/Our Approach:
	- Summary in 2-3 lines: Get buggy execution using some C11 verification tool, Add pseudo fences, find relations, eliminate fences
	3.1 Add pseudo fences:
	3.2 find relations
	3.3 eliminate fences
	3.4 Restricting buggy execution
	3.5 The fence minization problem
	
Implemetation:
	- summary: 
	we have also provided a flag for ... -t
	Why CDS? - RCMC, Tracer, GenMC: not for C11, Nidhugg: ??
	Translating model checker output: if a different model checker is used ...
		Extracting line numbers
	Optimizations
		Data structures- what and why?
		Algo
	
Results:
	System Specs
	Benchmarks - mutual exclusion, what operations
	Tables
	**Discussion/Obesevations**
