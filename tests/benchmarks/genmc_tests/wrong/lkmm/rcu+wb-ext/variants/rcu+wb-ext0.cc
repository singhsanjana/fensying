/*
 * Buggy test case. Exercises the interactions of WB with the rest of
 * LKMM.  It also shows why relations like rcu-link and rcu-fence
 * cannot be stored in local matrices in RCUCalculator, but rather
 * they have to be stored in the EG.

 * More specifically, in order to find the bug in this test case, we
 * have to locate some extension of WB that does not render the
 * execution invalid. The first one tried by genmc is invalid, and if
 * we do not restore rcu-link and rcu-fence to their earlier versions
 * (that did not take into account the extended WB), we will not be
 * able to find the bug. To do that restoration, however, we have to
 * store them along with all other matrices in the EG.
