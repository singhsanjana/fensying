/*
 * Test case by: Carlo Wood <carlo@alinoe.com>
 *
 * This test case demonstrates why special care when reading from stores
 * following failed CASes is necessary. More specifically, it shows that
 * a store stemming from a failed CAS can have an i64 type (same as the
 * CAS, which is performed on atomics/i64), but subsequent reads in the
 * same location can read based on the actual type of the variable (in
 * this test case pointer type). Thus, special care in the interpreter
 * regarding the type is needed when reading from such stores.
